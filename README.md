# How to install:
To preface, Windows will flag this program as potentially harmful, I promise it is not. To install this program download the .zip file from the repository. Once downloaded, extract the contents. In the folder should be 3 files: "ReadMe.txt", "Installer.exe", and "VR Executer.exe". If you want the program to run at startup make sure that you "Installer.exe" in the same folder that "VR Executer.exe" is in, it will copy "VR Executer.exe" to your startup folder. If you want to choose when the program runs, just copy "VR Executer.exe" to any loaction you like and discard the folder. 

# How to use:
To use this program all you need to do is start the executable. Once started, an icon should pop up in your system tray. If right clicked, a menu will pop up, the options will be "Switch ON/OFF" and "Quit". "SWITCH ON/OFF" enables and disables the program, you will recieve a notification telling you wether the program is enabled or not when clicked. "Quit" just quits the program, leaving behind no trace.

# Performance Impact:
From what I've seen using the program, no noticable performance is dropped. I ran a benchmark for exact numbers and enabled, the game remained about the same, only 1 or 2 frames were dropped. 

# Q&A:
## Will this work with roblox mods?
Yes, it should. This is because this is an external mod to roblox, not changing the game files.

## How do I play roblox VR?
Just go to the system tray, right click on the program icon, and select the "SWITCH ON/OFF" button.

## Will this affect SteamVR while I'm not playing roblox?
No, this program is specific to roblox and will only close SteamVR if it is running
