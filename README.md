# How to install:
To install this program download the .zip file from the repository. Once downloaded, extract the contents. In the folder should be 3 files: "README.md", "Installer.exe", and "VR Executer.exe". If you want the program to run at startup click on "Installer.exe", it will copy "VR Executer.exe" to your startup folder. If you want to choose when the program runs, just copy "VR Executer.exe" to any loaction you like and discard the folder. 

# How to use:
To use this program all you need to do is start the executable. Once started, an icon should pop up in your system tray. If right clicked, a menu will pop up, the options will be "Switch ON/OFF" and "Quit". "SWITCH ON/OFF" enables and disables the program, you will recieve a notification telling you wether the program is enabled or not when clicked. "Quit" just quits the program, leaving behind no trace.

# Performance Impact:
From what I've seen using the program, no noticable performance is dropped. I ran a benchmark for exact numbers and enabled, the game remained about the same, only 1 or 2 frames were dropped.
